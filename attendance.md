# Attendance

## Policy

You will take your own attendance through Garnet while on the `GA-Guest` wifi network. Please check [the graduation requirements for arriving on-time](graduation-requirements.md#attendance)!

If today begins at 9:00AM, then any attendance taken at 9:01 will be considered "tardy". Attendance cannot be taken three hours after the start time. That is: if you try to take attendance at 12:01, you will be considered "absent".

**There are no exceptions, even if you forgot and the instructors saw you were here.**

## How To Remember To Check In

- [Slack Reminders](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/208423427-Setting-reminders)
- [Google Calendar Reminders](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285327?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
- Remind each other!

Of course, Metro delays can happen. The solution is to leave every day earlier than you think you should. The instructors are on-time every day and we live all over the area. **If the instructors can do it, so can you!**

If you do arrive late, we'll ask that you not enter the classrooms until they go on break. Having folks coming in late is a huge distraction to the instructors and students, and if you come in late but can still sneak in then it's kind of a slap in the face to the students who are here on-time.

## How to do it

### 1. Log in to http://garnet.wdidc.org. You'll see something like this:

### 3. Click the blue "CHECK IN FOR..." button to the top-left.

This button will only be available for one hour after the beginning of the day. After that hour, you will be considered absent.
