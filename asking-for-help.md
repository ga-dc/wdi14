# Asking For Help

You can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. Slack is the most effective way to communicate with instructors. Please read further for additional guidelines on asking for help.

##One-on-Ones
An instructor will be available every Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday between 1:30PM - 2:30PM for 15 minute meetings by appointment. Please use the links below to schedule an appointment with an instructor.

One-on-Ones are a safe space to talk about literally anything. Topics might include:
- Code review
- Discussing concepts covered in class
- Talking about your career search
- Thinking through project ideas
- Generally shooting the breeze

**It's up to you** what gets discussed during the one-on-ones, so please come with questions prepared!

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- **please reach out directly to an instructor as soon as possible**.

**After 6pm**, aside from evening [office hours](office-hours.md), instructors may not be able to respond to technical questions until the following morning.

##Open Office Hours

Open office hours are generally from...
- 1:30PM to 2:30PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
- 6:00PM to 8:00PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The format is informal, the instructors "on duty" will send an announcement on slack and hang out by the student work area. If you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md).

You are strongly encouraged to use this time to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects.

## Technical Help

Outside of One-on-Ones and open office hours, we ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions..

1. Try something else
2. Google your exact problem or error
3. Reference the appropriate lesson plan
4. Ask another classmate
5. Ask an instructor

##Project Weeks

GitHub issues are the most useful method for answering technical questions. 90% of the time, at least one instructor will be dedicated to monitoring issues at all times during business hours. The other 10% will be announced in advance on Slack.

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```

[Just click this handy link to create an issue with these blanks inserted for you!](https://github.com/ga-dc/project1/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.)

*Please close your issues when you've received a satisfactory answer*, and let us know what the solution was! We'll close issues that have gone more than 30 minutes without any updates.

**Note:** Issues can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.

### Why Issues?

Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

### How?

Below is a guide for the information that must be included when submitting an issue. (You can also use the handy [template](https://github.com/ga-dc/project2/issues/new?title=issue+with+____&body=I+tried+_____.+I+expected+_____+to+happen._____+happened+instead.%0DMy+repo+link+is+___+and+my+question+is+about+lines+___.) above.) It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

#### Context

When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What user story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Gems and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried

Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?

**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?

**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person after you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
