# Open Office Hours

Open office hours are generally from...
- 1:30PM to 2:30PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
- 6:00PM to 8:00PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The format is informal, the instructors "on duty" will send an announcement on slack and hang out by the student work area. If you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md).

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects.
