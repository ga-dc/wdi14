# Open Office Hours

Open office hours are generally from...
- 1:30PM to 2:30PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
- 6:00PM to 8:00PM on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The format is informal: the instructors "on duty" hang out by the student work area, and if you get stuck, you can wander over and ask them a question, following the [guidelines on asking for help](asking-for-help.md).

You are strongly encouraged to use these times to also work with fellow students on assignments and projects.
