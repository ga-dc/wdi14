## Preparing for Your Headshots 

PLEASE BE ON TIME FOR YOUR SELCTED TIME SLOT! 

__**How to prepare for headshot:**__

When choosing your outfit, keep in mind that the photo will only display from your shoulder area up. It's always safe to wear solid dark colors. If you'd like to get creative, do it with bright colors and avoid busy patterns. Each person will have roughly 5 minutes in front of the camera, so this will allow for a (very quick) wardrobe change if you'd like to try two different looks. 

__Quick Tips:__
- If you are unsure about a clothing item or accessory, bring it. I will help you determine whether it will look good on camera.
- What works: dark, solid colors or bright, solid colors. Simple and authentic.
- Avoid pastels if possible.
- Avoid busy patterns, graphics, and logos
- Avoid plunging necklines

__Choosing Clothing: MEN__

- Beards: If you have a beard, trim it evenly so it’s nicely groomed. If you’re going clean-shaven, get a good shave that morning. The best rule of thumb for facial hair is to commit to your look- a beard, mustache, or nothing at all. Anything scruffy or stubbly in between is not advisable. Darker colored beards tend to be accentuated in photos- trim it well so it's not too thick.
- Think classic. Pick your favorite suit that fits you well and is preferably a classic dark color like navy blue or gray. Choose a suit that doesn't bunch up when you button it or sit down in it and a shirt and tie that match each other and the suit.
- Don't choose anything with bold, distracting patterns or colors. Clothing with tight grids or a small herringbone pattern can have a moiré pattern effect on camera, so stay away from grid like patterns. Thin stripes that are a little further apart are okay. Ties look best when their tone lands between the suit and the shirt- so a light shirt, a dark suit, and a tie in a shade somewhere between them. Some ties are too shiny- try to stay away from really reflective and shiny silk ties.
- If you don't wear a tie, choose a non-white shirt if possible: white shirts without a jacket and tie to break them up can lose detail in the color and folds. And if you wear a button-down shirt, it's best to wear a jacket or sweater of some kind to layer the look. If not, choose a darker color shirt or something with pockets or details to avoid it looking like a head floating on a blank, boxy shirt, and unbutton a button or two, or choose one without a collar and a medium or low neckline. And make sure we can't see your undershirt beneath the button-down shirt: wear a v-neck or no undershirt at all.

__Choosing Clothing: WOMEN__
- Choose a professional suit or outfit that has a classic look: you shouldn’t be able to tell what decade it is in the photo. Don’t choose anything with bold, distracting patterns or colors, unless you can layer a blazer or sweater over it so not much of the pattern is showing. Clothing with tight grids or a small herringbone pattern can have a moiré pattern effect on camera, so stay away from grid-like patterns. Thin stripes are okay.
- Try not to wear stark white unless it’s under something, such as a suit jacket, cardigan, or sweater. V-necks accentuate the neckline and generally look best on women. Just don’t choose something with too low of a neckline: no cleavage. No turtlenecks. They tend to make people look like they have no neck at all in photos.
- Makeup: How much is too much? Everyone is different, so it depends on how much make-up you usually wear: you want your headshots to be easily recognizable as how you generally look in person. For some people, that means wearing your make-up exactly how you usually wear it, for others it's wearing a little more, for others a little less. If you don't wear much makeup every day, don't do your makeup like Kim Kardashian for your photos. Choose light to medium eyeliners, eye shadows, and lipsticks that are only a shade or two darker than your skin tones. This brings your features out in a subtle manner without making it look like you're wearing lots of makeup. Avoid caking on heavy foundation, or wearing shiny eye shadows or lip-gloss: too much shine is distracting on camera and looks wet.
